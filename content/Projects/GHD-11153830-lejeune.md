Fire Protection Engineer responsible for analyzing hazards associated with a large paint spray area in a steel manufacturing facility. The primary hazard evaluated was large quantities of flammable liquids used to paint large steel members in an un-sprinklered area. Multiple pool fire scenarios were evaluated to determine if tenability and structural steel goals would be met without the installation of new sprinklers.
