Fire Protection Engineer responsible for egress modeling. Pathfinder was used to simulate a full occupant load evacuating all three floors plus the basement. Scenarios were developed corresponding with the design fires required in NFPA 101 to assess blocked exits. In addition to the egress modeling, he reviewed the egress calculations for accuracy and determining sufficient egress capacity.
